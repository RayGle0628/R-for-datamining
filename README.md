# R-for-datamining
At present, open source software such as R and Python is in the ascendant, but the learning curve of such software is slow, 
and many enthusiasms for beginners disappear before entering the core area of data analysis. 
The real purpose of business data analysis is to solve business analysis needs and construct a robust data mining model. 
The quality of data mining products is guaranteed by strict control over the analysis process. 
This library focuses on practicality, points directly to the main points of data mining implementation, 
and selects the most widely used implementation solutions in the industry, saving readers valuable time. 
Compared to Python, R prefers statistical analysis, econometrics, and statistical content. R not only has a 
broad user base in academic research, but also combines with database software such as Oracle and SQL Sever to make it no longer limited by memory,
which has a certain commercial use. And R and Hadoop, Spark and other big data analysis platforms can also be freely connected.
